0.8 - 1.7.2 Up
=============
* UUID access is now the preferred method of accessing player stat blobs
  * To this end an option has been added to the config (default: on, switches itself off after completion) 
    to on startup query Mojang's username->uuid service to update the database.
* added several helper methods to make recording stats easier
* Breaking? Entity taming is now under it's own category as opposed to tameENTITYNAME
* New: documents system
  * This allows BeardStat to record non-numeric stats data about a player.
  * document api supports versioning and merging as well as "single instance" or no history documents.
  * BeardStat itself will not have things that utilise this.
    * But I do plan to release a "Inventory display" plugin that will record the users current inventory to a document, allowing viewing online.
    * I also plan to do a killboard style plugin (x killed y with z listing).

* Access to metadata on keys (domain,world,category,statistic) from ingame.
* Breaking: API now supports non player entities having stats
